<h3>Some about team</h3>
<p>Team was create national federation footbal.
    Ego is a skinny yet tall, pale man with his black hair styled into a short bob cut 
    with straight bangs and is often seen wearing a pair of black framed eye glasses, 
    black jeans with a belt and a black shirt with a bolo tie on his neck. 
    By the time of the Neo Egoist League, Ego's hair has gotten noticeably longer</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ego at first glance, is an ambitious and overly confident man; 
        Beneath that ambition however, is something even more sinister as he puts the 
        emphasis in "ego" as he is shown to be an extremely egotistical, cruel,
         and self-serving man, seeing teamwork and putting your teammates before yourself 
         to the equivalent of being "second-rate." He never wastes an opportunity 
         to tell his players the cold truth about themselves and their reality, 
         either seeping them into further despair or inspiring them with his
          cold hearted truth.</p>


          <p>How you are think a head coach a Ego Dzinpachi.</p>

<h3>Next character is a Anri Teieri</h3>
<p>Anri Teieri (帝襟 アンリ Teieri Anri?) 
    is a new hire of the Japan Football Union. 
    Sometime after the defeat of the Japan National Team in the 2018 World Cup,
     Anri proposes to the executives of the Japan Football Union a plan
      to help Japan succeed in winning the World Cup.</p>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bluelock/images/1/15/Anri_Teieri.png/revision/latest?cb=20191027131709" alt="Тут Ари">
<p>Anri is a calm but very determined young woman whose biggest 
    dream is to see Japan win the World Cup. Anri is passionate when it comes
     to football and although the majority 
     in the Japan Football Association ridiculed her and treat her as nothing more 
     than a woman with big dreams and a big chest, she sticks to her goals and visions. 
     She also speaks her mind, unaffected by the business-minded
      Japan Football Association ideologies.</p>
      <p><em>Both of these men want to take Japanese football to the next level.</em></p>
