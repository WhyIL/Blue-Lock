   <h2>Кто же такой этот Чигири Хёма?</h2>
<p><em>Chigiri from a very young age has always thought 
    himself superior to others due to his naturally strong muscles, 
    amazing skill in football, and his outstanding speed. He for awhile 
    looked down on those who got in his way or annoyed him but was mostly modest.
     Only when he tears his ACL does his sense of superiority start to crumble
      and due to being harassed by the Wanima Brothers he becomes afraid of playing 
      football wholeheartedly. He becomes so afraid of never playing football again
       that he rather find a reason to quit than to persevere for his dream.</em></p>

    <p><em>When retaking a hold of his ego and ambition, Chigiri has shown to be a
     persistent and stubborn force on the field. He always strives to leave 
     an effect on the field, which causes other players to notice him and 
     acknowledge his abilities. Chigiri is shown to have great focus being
      a player who is constantly running through tight spaces, between players,
       and even switching from dribbling to passing. Chigiri admits that he feels 
       a great joy surpassing other players with his speed, and when is inspired by
       Isagi and retakes his will to play and win he finally leaves behind his fear
        and begins to once again be that player he used to be in middle school and 
        states he will become the best striker in the world.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>He enjoys taking care of his appearance often like blow 
    drying and taking care of his hair and many other player
    s have noticed. He also speaks about how he cares towards
     his injured knee.</em></p>
    
   <p><em> Chigiri is also easy-going and friendly outside of the
     field. While on the Team Z, he often talks casually with
     Kunigami and eventually makes a team with him fully trusting 
     in each other, demonstrating a great chemistry on the field. 
     After he joins Team White in the Second Selection, he is seen 
     to get along very well with Nagi, watching together videos about professional 
     players and latter playing together in a contest with shoes in which they compite
      to see which one of them can dominate with their shoes making a mess in their 
      bedroom.</em></p>
